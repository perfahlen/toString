geometry.toString - what does it mean?

http://thinkgit.blogspot.se/2017/10/what-does-geometrytostring-mean.html

In web development with JavaScript or similar, what is the meaning of geometry.toString()? I was developing a small application and started to think may be it is time to do something more interesting than [object] or Uncaught Not implemented. What if toString() would return the actual string representation of the object? That would make toString() useful.
